### JavaScript & DOM Fundamentals

- [ ] ES6: The current version of JavaScript is ES2016 (aka ES7), but a lot of developers still haven’t properly learned ES6. It’s time to learn.

- [x] Builtin methods: Learn methods for the standard data types (especially arrays, objects, strings, and numbers).

- [ ] Functions & pure functions: You probably think you’ve got a great grasp of functions, but JavaScript has some tricks up its sleeves, and you’ll need to learn about pure functions to get a handle on functional programming.

- [ ] Closures: Learn how JavaScript’s function scopes behave.

- [x] Callbacks: A callback is a function used by another function to signal when there is a result ready. You say, “do your job, call me when it’s done.”

- [ ] Promises: A promise is a way to deal with future values. When a function returns a promise, you can attach callbacks using the .then() method to run after the promise resolves. The resolved value is passed into your callback function, e.g., doSomething().then(value => console.log(value));

- [ ] Ajax & server API calls: Most interesting apps eventually need to talk to the network. You should know how to communicate with APIs.

- [ ] Classes (note: Avoid class inheritance. See How to Use Classes and Sleep at Night.)

- [ ] Functional programming basics: Functional programming produces programs by composing mathematical functions, avoiding shared state & mutable data. It’s been years since I’ve seen a production JavaScript app that didn’t make heavy use of functional programming. It’s time to master the fundamentals.

- [ ] Generators & async/await: In my opinion, the best way to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. It has a learning curve, but once you’ve learned it, the code will be easier to read.

- [ ] Performance: RAIL — Start with “PageSpeed Insights” & “WebPageTest.org”

- [ ] Progressive Web Applications (PWAs): See “Native Apps are Doomed” & “Why Native Apps Really Are Doomed”

- [x] Node & Express: Node lets you use JavaScript on the server, meaning your users can store data in the cloud and access it anywhere. Express is the most popular framework for Node by a landslide.

- [ ] Mongo/Mongoose

- [ ] React

- [ ] React Native

- [ ] Redux

- [ ] GraphQl
