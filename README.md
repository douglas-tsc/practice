# api
This project is to help me learn how to write a RESTful API with meteor

I'm following this [tutorial by the meteor chef](https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/writing-an-api/?utm_campaign=Adoption%3A%20Developer&utm_content=23717520&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter).

- [ ] Continue from [this point](https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/writing-an-api/#tmc-key-display-and-regeneration) to show users their automatically generated api key.

## Packages Included:

```meteor add iron:router check random http```
