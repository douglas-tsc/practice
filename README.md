HTML and CSS practice comes from [The Complete Web Developer Course]()

I found [DASH](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) helpful when I was first learning about HTML and CSS.

If you're just getting into code I recommend [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/), I wish it was around when I started.

Flexbox practice is from [What The Flexbox?!](http://flexbox.io/) by Wes Bos.

I also found [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) helpful.
