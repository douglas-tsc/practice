## My Response

Hello,

I understand you are looking for a complete redesign of your Emergency Exit Lighting website.

If you want a site that communicates the key features of your product, I can help build a website that emphasizes the relevance of their benefits.

If you want people making the decision to keep their families safe, rather than thinking about the cost of emergency lighting, then here is a demo of what you website could look like:

PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINK ABOVE FOR A DEMO OF YOUR SITE.

If the design is not what you were hoping for, I can adjust the layout, and tweak the color palette to suit. If you give me 2-3 examples of websites you like the look and feel of it will help a lot.

If you want to integrate a payment portal or a third party service like a chat widget I can do so. If you have a system in mind, I can integrate it. If you want me to suggest a service, I would be happy to.

If you don't want to move your current site, I could rebuild something similar on SquareSpace, where you are currently hosting the website. Alternatively, we could rebuild most of the website and keep the blog on SquareSpace so that you don't lose any of your old links.

I am more than happy to answer any questions you have before moving forward.

I do my best to make the experience of getting a  new website as hassle-free as possible for my clients. Here is some feedback I had from my last three projects:

"Josh was a delight to work with; always cooperative, creative, responsive and technically excellent at his job - went above and beyond."  
- Bec Evans and Chris Smith, Founders of Prolifiko  

"Super easy to work with."  
- Kristin Braddock, Social Entrepreneur  

"Working with Josh was a great experience. His sense of design, aesthetics, and flow of information was amazing. I am very pleased with his work and recommend him very highly."
-Raju Arora, Founder

If you would like to hire me to redesign your website, I have put together two options for you.

OPTION 1: Website redesign

This would involve a professional, modern website redesign. However, you will need to provide the content (writing and images).

This option costs $1111 (which is $1000 plus 10% for Up work)

OPTION 2: Website redesign + Copywriting + Technical SEO

This option involves redesigning you website as well as rewriting the content for your website.

I can create a simple and persuasive business narrative that helps communicate the relevance and importance of your products to your customers.

I will then edit the content so that it is optimized for one Google search phrase and three keywords of your choice (I can help you choose these if you don't already have keywords).

I will also compress the images, minify all the code and complete all the search rank requirements so that you site indexes higher on Google searches.

Taking the time to do this also means your site will be accessible to blind people and the physically disadvantaged since screen readers work much the same way as search engines.

I have uploaded a black and white version of my design to show you that I have already designed the site with colour-blind people in mind.

The second option costs $2420 (which is $2200 plus 10% for Up work)

If you would like go for the second option, I will need to send you a questionnaire, or speak to you for half an hour over Skype, so that I have the information I need to get started.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you.

I have spent considerable time putting this together if you do not want to hire me all I ask if that you let me know why. Feedback is invaluable for someone starting out as a web developer.
