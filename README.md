# Mantra Journal

<img src='mantra.png'/>

Mantra is an application architecture for making apps with Meteor and React. You can read more about it [here](https://kadirahq.github.io/mantra/).

To figure out how to use it I followed [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@ottovw/compose-your-awesome-new-web-app-6fba9c6b241b#.1dwyqbm0l) by Otto von Wachter. It's a little outdated and the structure has changed but not by much so it's great to learn the basics. Super simple journal app.

Then you can add users to the app by following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@kenrogers/build-a-journaling-app-with-meteor-1-3-beta-react-react-bootstrap-and-mantra-7965d9e9fc23#d887) by Ken Rogers. Slightly more complex and uses the new structure. Make sure you read the comment sin the footer, as of writing this the article has loads of typos and won't run. If you read the comments you should be able to figure it out.

Once you understand how mantra is structured you can play with the [official manta sample app](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app) and add comments to your app. There is no tutorial but by this point it should be easy enough to figure out.

### More Meteor + React Tutorials
