## My Response

Hello,

With the understanding that you are looking for a professional website for a cancer surgeon, I took the liberty of designing your site for my proposal.

This is an example of I can design for you:
[http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website01/](http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website01/)

The website was designed to look aesthetically pleasing on mobile phones and tablets, as requested.

I don't know what type of cancer you treat so I picked a calming, yet professional, blue palette. If you could tell me more about your practice, I could tailor the palette and icons better.

We can rearrange the sections however you would like. If you want to add a photography section, a pricing table, a case study or any other kind of segment I can do that.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Thank you,

Josh
