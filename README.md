#### Call-To-Action
On every product page there will be a form the user may use to contact a Pack-Smart Inc. representative. The form will have the following mandatory fields:
1.	Name
2.	Email
3.	Phone
4.	Subject
5.	Text Box

#### Materials Processed
A bullet point list of materials that can be processed by the Pack-Smart product. This list is low priority in terms of visual space to be allotted for it, however it is still very important to have a comprehensive list of the materials to give the user a greater understanding of the flexibility and vast materials that can be handled by Pack-Smart products.

# My Response

Hello,

I understand you are looking to redesign the Pack Smart website.

I have put together an example of what I could do for your company.

[http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website05/](http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website05/)

PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINK ABOVE FOR A DEMO OF YOUR SITE.

This is a demonstration for your product pages only. The brief only outlined requirements for the product pages. If you like the design I can use the same approach for the rest of the website.

If the design is not what you are looking for, I can adjust the layout and color palette to suit. If you give me 2-3 examples of websites you like the look and feel of it will help a lot.

If you want to integrate a payment portal or a third party service like a chat widget I can do so. If you have a system in mind, I can integrate it. If you want me to suggest a service, I would be happy to.

I do my best to make the experience of getting a new website as hassle-free as possible for my clients.

Here is some feedback I had from my last three projects:

"Josh was a delight to work with; always cooperative, creative, responsive and technically excellent at his job - went above and beyond."

Bec Evans and Chris Smith, Founders of Prolifiko
"Super easy to work with."

Kristin Braddock, Social Entrepreneur
"Working with Josh was a great experience. His sense of design, aesthetics, and flow of information was amazing. I am very pleased with his work and recommend him very highly."

-Raju Arora, Founder

If you would like me to redesign your website, I have put together two options for your company.

OPTION 1: Website redesign

This would involve a professional, modern website redesign. For this option you will need to provide the content (writing and images).

This option costs $2200 (which is $2000 plus 10% for Upwork)

OPTION 2: Website redesign + Copywriting + Technical SEO

This option involves redesigning you website as well as rewriting the content for your site.

I can create a simple, persuasive business narrative that helps emphasize the benefits of what you are offering to your customers.

I will then edit the content and optimize it for one Google search phrase and three keywords of your choice (I can help you choose these if you don't already have keywords).

I will also make sure that all of the websites complies with the latest web standards. Taking the time to do this means search engines will love your site. It also means the site will be accessible to blind people and the physically disadvantaged since screen readers work much the same way as search engines.

I have uploaded a black and white version of my design to show that I have already designed the site with colour-blind people in mind. I wanted to be as inclusive as possible.

The second option costs $4840 (which is $4400 plus 10% for Up work)

If you would like go for the second option, I will need to send you a questionnaire (or  we could speak over Skype) so that I have the information I need to get started.
Since I have spent considerable time putting this together, if you do not want to hire me all I ask if that you let me know why. Feedback is immensely helpful and will always be appreciated.

I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have before moving forward.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you.

Joshua Pitzalis

# [Stuff to Learn in 2017](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711#.ipb8zp7ri)


## JavaScript & DOM Fundamentals
Before you try to land a job using JavaScript, you should have a good grasp of JavaScript fundamentals:

Builtin methods: Learn methods for the standard data types (especially arrays, objects, strings, and numbers).

Functions & pure functions: You probably think you’ve got a great grasp of functions, but JavaScript has some tricks up its sleeves, and you’ll need to learn about pure functions to get a handle on functional programming.

Closures: Learn how JavaScript’s function scopes behave.

Callbacks: A callback is a function used by another function to signal when there is a result ready. You say, “do your job, call me when it’s done.”

Promises: A promise is a way to deal with future values. When a function returns a promise, you can attach callbacks using the .then() method to run after the promise resolves. The resolved value is passed into your callback function, e.g., doSomething().then(value => console.log(value));

Ajax & server API calls: Most interesting apps eventually need to talk to the network. You should know how to communicate with APIs.

ES6: The current version of JavaScript is ES2016 (aka ES7), but a lot of developers still haven’t properly learned ES6. It’s past time.

Classes (note: Avoid class inheritance. See How to Use Classes and Sleep at Night.)

Functional programming basics: Functional programming produces programs by composing mathematical functions, avoiding shared state & mutable data. It’s been years since I’ve seen a production JavaScript app that didn’t make heavy use of functional programming. It’s time to master the fundamentals.

Generators & async/await: In my opinion, the best way to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. It has a learning curve, but once you’ve learned it, the code will be easier to read.

Performance: RAIL — Start with “PageSpeed Insights” & “WebPageTest.org”

Progressive Web Applications (PWAs): See “Native Apps are Doomed” & “Why Native Apps Really Are Doomed”

Node & Express: Node lets you use JavaScript on the server, meaning your users can store data in the cloud and access it anywhere. Express is the most popular framework for Node by a landslide.

Lodash: A great, modular utility belt for JavaScript, packed with functional programming goodies. Import the data-last functional modules from lodash/fp.

## React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created by Facebook. It’s based on the idea of uni-directional data flow, meaning that for each update cycle:
React takes inputs to components as props and conditionally renders DOM updates if data has changed for specific parts of the DOM. Data updates during this phase can’t retrigger the render until the next drawing phase.
Event handling phase — after the DOM has rendered, React listens for and events, delegating events to a single event listener at the root of its DOM tree (for better performance). You can listen to those events and update data in response.
Using any changes to the data, the process repeats at 1.
This is in contrast to 2-way data binding, where changes to the DOM may directly update data (e.g., as is the case with Angular 1 and Knockout). With 2-way binding, changes to the DOM during the DOM render process (called the digest cycle in Angular 1) can potentially retrigger the drawing phase before the drawing is finished, causing reflows and repaints — slowing performance.
React does not prescribe a data management system, but a Flux-based approach is recommended. React’s 1-way data flow approach borrowing ideas from functional programming and immutable data structures transformed the way we think about front-end framework architecture.

For more on React & Flux architecture, read “The Best Way to Learn to Code is to Code: Learn App Architecture by Building Apps”.

create-react-app*: The quickest way to get started with React.

react-router*: Dead simple routing for React.

Next.js*: Dead simple Universal render & Routing for Node & React.

velocity-react*: Animations for React — allows you to use the VMD bookmarklet for interactive visual motion design on your pages.

## Redux
Redux provides transactional, deterministic state management for your apps. In Redux, we iterate over a stream of action objects to reduce to the current application state. To learn why that’s important, read “10 Tips for Better Redux Architecture.”

To get started with Redux, check out the excellent courses by the creator of Redux, Dan Abramov:
“Getting Started with Redux”
“Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux”

Redux is mandatory learning, even if you never use Redux for a production project.

Why?

Because it will give you lots of practice and teach you the value of using pure functions and teach you new ways to think about reducers, which are general-purpose functions for iterating over collections of data and extracting some value from them. Reducers are so generally useful that Array.prototype.reduce was added to the JS specification.
Reducers are important for more than just arrays, and learning new ways of working with Reducers is valuable all by itself.
redux-saga*: A synchronous-style side-effect library for Redux. Use this to manage I/O (such as handling network requests).
