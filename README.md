# 100 Websites in 100 Days

To learn how to code I am making 100 websites in 100 days.

## The Story

I created an account on Upwork and starting looking for jobs I liked. Instead of telling people what I could do for them in my proposal, I challenged myself to make the website and send it to them instead.

I don't want to spend more than two or three hours on each website. The goal is to learn my numbers. My hypothesis is that I will learn how to make better websites by creating 100 low-fidelity websites in quick succession than I would by focusing on quality.

## The Rules

Momentum is the priority.

If a client likes my proposal and wants more work done on the website, I can only work on it after I have created my website for that day.

I may get sick or I might not have an internet connection some days. If I don't get a website out on that day, then the deadlines extends. So if I miss three days by the end of it it will be 100 websites in 103 days. The bottom line is that I make 100 websites in a short a time as possible. If I don't finish by the end of the year the game ends.

I will be using a framework called the 'Startup Design Framework' by Designmodo when I start. I can use what ever combination of frameworks I like, just as long as I don't use website builders or online editors.

If clients wants a blog with the website I can attach a third party blog to the website (like WordPress) as long as the blog is not the main page.

The goal is to become better at building websites form scratch not using website building or installing themes.

## The Websites

I'll post links to new websites here each day.

I have included the Briefs for context but omitted client names and details for privacy. Click on the day for that day's brief.

These website layouts are all in the public domain now so you are more than welcome to use them for your own projects.
