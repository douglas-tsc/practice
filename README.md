# 100 Websites in 100 Days
My name is Josh and I am making 100 websites in 100 days.
## This is website #7.

### [Website Design for a Packaging Equipment Manufacturing Company](http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website05/)

# The Project Brief

An existing website - [http://academiadebaile.net/](http://academiadebaile.net/) - needs to be redesigned.

It will be a basic one page design with a few menu links, a slide-show and descriptive text about the studio.

Here are some specifics:

The slide show is a key part of the home page and needs to cycle through all the photos placed in a folder within the web structure.  There could be a hundred or more photos there.

The group picture you see at the bottom of the existing web site needs to stay in the same position.

I will provide an overall layout suggestion and color requirements.

The site is hosted at http://www.powweb.com/ and you will be given a login so you can get the site up and running.

#My Response

Hello,

I understand you are looking to redesign the dance academy website.

I found your work request on Upwork. I tried to post my proposal but the project got taken down before I could.

I have put together an example of what I could do for your company.

PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINK ABOVE FOR A DEMO OF YOUR SITE.

The colours and layout can be changed in any way you like. This is just a demonstration based on the brief that you outlined.

I do my best to make the experience of getting a new website as hassle-free as possible for my clients.

Here is some feedback I had from my last three projects:

"Josh was a delight to work with; always cooperative, creative, responsive and technically excellent at his job - went above and beyond."

Bec Evans and Chris Smith, Founders of Prolifiko
"Super easy to work with."

Kristin Braddock, Social Entrepreneur
"Working with Josh was a great experience. His sense of design, aesthetics, and flow of information was amazing. I am very pleased with his work and recommend him very highly."

-Raju Arora, Founder

I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I look forward to hearing from you.

Joshua Pitzalis
