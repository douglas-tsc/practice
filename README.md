## My Response

Hello,

I understand you are looking for a redesign your property management company website.

I have put together an example of what I could do for your company.

[http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website10/](http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website10/)

PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINK ABOVE FOR A DEMO OF YOUR SITE.

The above site is a quick demonstration only. I can adjust the layout and color palette to suit. If you give me 2-3 examples of websites you like the look and feel of I can get a better sense of what you have in mind.

As the site above is a quick demo only, it has not been optimized for mobile viewing. It certainly will be if you decide to higher me for the job. All of my work is mobile responsive and works across browsers.

You mentioned that you want to integrate a payment portal. That is definitely something I can do. Do you already have a system in mind, if so I can integrate it. If you want me to suggest a service, I would be happy to.

I can also incorporate a carousel with rotating photos. Do you have high-quality images I can use?

I can also integrate cloud storage. I am assuming this is to hold all the form and such?

With regard to your request for social media integration, do you just want links to you pages or do you want a section with a feed of your social media stream. Either can be done. It was just a little unclear.

I think I am a good fit for this job because I do a lot of work on business landing pages and websites for freelancers.

I am quoting a much lower rate than my usual hourly service because I am new to Upwork and I am looking for a 5-star review and great feedback to help get my profile started.

I do my best to make the experience of getting a new website as hassle-free as possible for my clients.

Here is some feedback I had from my last three projects:

"Josh was a delight to work with; always cooperative, creative, responsive and technically excellent at his job - went above and beyond."

Bec Evans and Chris Smith, Founders of Prolifiko
"Super easy to work with."

Kristin Braddock, Social Entrepreneur
"Working with Josh was a great experience. His sense of design, aesthetics, and flow of information was amazing. I am very pleased with his work and recommend him very highly."

-Raju Arora, Founder

If you would like me to redesign your website, I have put together two options for your company.

OPTION 1: Website redesign

This would involve a professional, modern website redesign. For this option, you will need to provide the content (writing and images).

OPTION 2: Website redesign + Design Work

This option involves redesigning you website as well as designing a new logo and a set of icon, like the handshake icon on the demo site. Custom design work is not important of you are happy with your current logo but if you are looking to refresh your brand image I would recommend it.

I am sorry for not using your logo in the demo site. I couldn't get a high-quality cut out of it. If you can send me the logo file I would be happy to include it so that you can see what it looks like.


OPTION 3: Website redesign + Design + Copywriting + Technical SEO

This option involves redesigning you website as well as rewriting the content for your site.

I can create a simple, persuasive business narrative that helps emphasize the benefits of what you are offering to your customers.

I can also help reduce the amount of question you get sent in by including responses to the most commonly asked question into the copy on the website.

I will then edit the content and optimize it for one Google search phrase and three keywords of your choice (I can help you choose these if you don't already have keywords).

I will also make sure that all of the websites complies with the latest web standards. Taking the time to do this means search engines will love your site. It also means the site will be accessible to blind people and the physically disadvantaged since screen readers work much the same way as search engines.

If you would like go for the second or third option, I will need to send you a questionnaire (Or we could speak over Skype) so that I have the information I need to get started.

Since I have spent considerable time putting this together, if you do not want to hire me all I ask if that you let me know why. Feedback is immensely helpful and is always appreciated.

I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have before moving forward.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you.

### Which of the required job skills do you feel you are strongest at?

I think building landing pages for businesses is my strongest card. This means being able to combine copywriting, design and coding skills. I may not be the best at each one, but I being good enough at all three makes much better than a lot of the competition when it comes to building a website for a business that requires coding, design and copywriting.

### Do you have any questions about the job description?

Will you be providing images for me to work with?

What kind of payment portal would you like integrated? or would you like em to help you pick.
