##what is the difference between git and gitHub?

 Git is a version control system. A version control system lets people build software collaboratively without getting in each other's way.  

 GitHub is an online storage service that makes it easy to backup and manage all the different versions of a project. GitHub uses Git but they are not the same thing. There are other service just like Github that do the same thing (like Bitbucket and Kiln). All these services use Git.

 All Git does is give you a history of all the different versions of a piece of software. Every time you write code and save it you create a new version of the software.

 Having every version of a piece of software is useful when you are working with other people because it lets you see if anyone else has made any changes to the software since you last worked on it. 

 You can also merge versions together. Conflicts can then be resolved when you merge similiar versions. 

 You can also go back to a previous version if you ever break something.

 All useful stuff when collaborating.

 If you want to use git you will need to install it on your computer first.

 + If you are using a mac, the easiest thing is to install git with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). 

 + Windows use [http://git-scm.com/download/win](http://git-scm.com/download/win). 

 + Linux install using these instructions [http://git-scm.com/download/linux](http://git-scm.com/download/linux).
