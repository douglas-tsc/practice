# slider
Understanding the flow of props and state by building a simple progress bar whose value is controlled by a range slider.

Followed the tutorial at the bottom half of this[ meteor chef post](https://themeteorchef.com/snippets/understanding-props-and-state-in-react/).

Had to follow the start js file from [the official meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/components) to get it to show up in the browser.

Also needed to add the following packages;
```meteor add react fourseven:scss
twbs:bootstrap```
