##Coming Soon Landing Page
I want to have a "Coming Soon" landing page for a startup I'm creating.  I want it to be extremely simple since its quasi-stealth.  It could be as simple as "We do XYZ" ...and... "Enter your email to notify me when the product is available"

In the not too distant future, I'll need someone to design and build a website.  (for a financial services business).

If anyone has some QUICK advice on what I need to ask in order to pick the right website designer / developer person, that would be appreciated.  An example might be ...(use Mailchimp or Aweber) to ensure “email signup form” integrates with my newsletter service.

PLEASE don't invest too much into a response.  This project will be quick.  Website samples (from a portfolio) (clean, simple) are very much appreciated.

thanks in advance,

Client

Hello Client,

I understand you are looking for a simple landing page with an email entry form.

I have put together the following example for you:
[http://joshpitzalis.github.io/websites/](http://joshpitzalis.github.io/websites/)

It's clean, professional and can be modified however you want. For example, if you don't have a video we can replace that bit with some text. If you don't have any testimonials we can take that section away.

I also built it in a way that it will be easy to add sections to build it out into a complete website in the future.

If you like the layout, you will need to provide the words for me to add. Alternatively, if you don't already have the content we can arrange a half-an-hour skype call, so I can ask you a few question and write the content out for you.

I don't understand what you mean about QUICK advice. If you are looking for suggestion on what email manager to use MailChimp and Aweber are great but they are complicated. A much simpler alternative would be Tiny Letter or Mad Mini. They are super simple to use, free and easy to set up. I can do all of that for you

You will also need to think about server space to host the website. They can cost between $5 and $50 a month depending on how much traffic you are expecting.

Also do you have a domain? If not, do you want one? Happy to help with that too.

Let me know.

Take care,

Josh
