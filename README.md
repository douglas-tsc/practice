## The Project Brief

### I need a web site

I have a web site: parlayvacay.com that is no where close to being good enough because it is too busy (I want something much cleaner and classier) but it has all of the info. on it.  

I have a new language learning vacation company offering its first course in February which happens to be  a course in Spanish (other languages will follow in the future) on a cruise to Mexico (other courses may be combined with tours of wine country or at all inclusive golf resorts or at wellness retreat spas).  The company name is Parlay Vacay and the image conveyed needs to show without being confusing how we perfectly combine language learning with R&R.

The courses are not super cheap, so I need a somewhat classier or upscale look to our marketing without losing the tone of our slogan: Relax.  Learn a language.  Eventually, I will also be needing two-sided business cards that have a look consistent with the web site.  

I am looking for a longterm relationship with a reliable designer!  Thanks for your time and effort!

## My Response

Hello,

A language learning vacation sounds like an exciting business. I like it.

I have put together an example of what I could do for you. I have tried my best to convey a sense of both luxury and clarity, to communicate how you combine language learning with R&R.

I have stayed close to your original palette but made a few changes so that it better matches the tone of your slogan.

PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINK ABOVE FOR A DEMO OF YOUR SITE.

If the design is not what you were hoping for, I can adjust the layout, and tweak the color palette to suit. If you give me 2-3 examples of websites you like the look and feel of it will help a lot.

If you want to integrate a payment portal or a third party service like a chat widget I can do so. If you have a system in mind, I can integrate it. If you want me to suggest a service, I would be happy to.

I haven't linked to your blog because there was not much content on there. I can create a link to it, or I can help set up a new blog.

I do my best to make the experience of getting a  new website as hassle-free as possible for my clients.

Here is some feedback I had from my last three projects:

"Josh was a delight to work with; always cooperative, creative, responsive and technically excellent at his job - went above and beyond."  
- Bec Evans and Chris Smith, Founders of Prolifiko  

"Super easy to work with."  
- Kristin Braddock, Social Entrepreneur  

"Working with Josh was a great experience. His sense of design, aesthetics, and flow of information was amazing. I am very pleased with his work and recommend him very highly."
-Raju Arora, Founder

If you would like to hire me to redesign your website, I have put together two options for you.

OPTION 1: Website redesign

This would involve a professional, modern website redesign. However, you will need to provide the content (writing and images).

Like I said before, if the proposed design is not what you were hoping for, I can adjust the layout, and tweak the color palette to suit. We can add, remove or rearrange any sections you like.

This option costs $1111 (which is $1000 plus 10% for Up work)

OPTION 2: Website redesign + Copywriting + Technical SEO

This option involves redesigning you website as well as rewriting the content for your site.

I can create a simple and persuasive business narrative that helps emphasize the benefits of what you are offering to your customers.

I will then edit the content and optimize it for one Google search phrase and three keywords of your choice (I can help you choose these if you don't already have keywords).  

I will also make sure that all of the websites complies with the latest web standards. Taking the time to do this means search engines will love your site. It also means the site will be accessible to blind people and the physically disadvantaged since screen readers work much the same way as search engines.

I have uploaded a black and white version of my design to show that I have already designed the site with colour-blind people in mind. I wanted to be as inclusive as possible.

The second option costs $2420 (which is $2200 plus 10% for Up work)

If you would like go for the second option, I will need to send you a questionnaire. We could also speak for half an hour over Skype so that I have the information I need to get started.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you.

I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have before moving forward.

I usually charge more for my work, but I like your business and would like to work on it. You mentioned that you are looking for a long term relationship. I am happy to lower my rates in the interest of building a mutually-beneficial long-term relationship.

You also mentioned that you may need a business card designed. I spent some time designing the logo used on the website so that you get a sense of what I can offer design wise.

Since I have spent considerable time putting this together, if you do not want to hire me all I ask if that you let me know why. Feedback is immensely helpful and will always be appreciated.
