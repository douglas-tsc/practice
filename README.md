# 100 Websites in 101 Days

My name is Josh and I am making 100 websites in 100 days. I missed one day so far.

Scroll the to bottom to see the websites.

## The Story

I created an account on Upwork and starting looking for jobs I liked.

Instead of telling people what I could do for them in my proposal, I challenged myself to make the website and then send it to them.

The goal is to learn my numbers. My hypothesis is that I will learn how to make better websites by creating 100 low-fidelity websites in quick succession than I would by focusing on quality.

## The Rules

+ Momentum is the priority. I may get sick. I might not have an internet connection some days. If I don't get a website out on that day, then the deadline extends. For example, if I miss three days by the end of the project it will be 100 websites in 103 days. The bottom line is that I make 100 websites in as short a time as possible. If I don't finish this by the end of the year its over.

+ I can use what ever combination of frameworks I like, as long as I don't use website builders or online editors. The goal is to become better at building websites form scratch not using website building or installing themes.

## The Websites

I'll post links to new websites here each day.

I have included the Briefs for context. Click on the day for that day's brief.
