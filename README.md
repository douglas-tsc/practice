# Curocracy
A curated news website focusing on technology and entrepreneurship in India

## Why are you developing this?
India has it's own version of Hacker news but it is now overrun with spam. We deserve a better alternative.

## What did we use to build it?

### Meteor

+ Code in the /server directory only runs on the server.
+ Code in the /client directory only runs on the client.
+ Everything else runs on both the client and server.
+ Your static assets (fonts, images, etc.) go in the /public directory.
+ Files in /lib are loaded before anything else.
+ Any main.* file is loaded after everything else.
+ Everything else loads in alphabetical order based on the file name.

### Packages

+ Bootstrap

## How do you get it running?
