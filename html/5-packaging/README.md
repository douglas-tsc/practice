#### Materials Processed

This list is low priority in terms of visual space to be allotted for it, however it is still very important to have a comprehensive list of the materials to give the user a greater understanding of the flexibility and vast materials that can be handled by Pack-Smart products.

# My Response

Hello,

I understand you are looking to redesign the Pack Smart website.

I have put together an example of what I could do for your company.

[http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website05/](http://joshpitzalis.github.io/website05/)

PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINK ABOVE FOR A DEMO OF YOUR SITE.

This is a demonstration for your product pages only. The brief only outlined requirements for the product pages. If you like the design I can use the same approach for the rest of the website.

If the design is not what you are looking for, I can adjust the layout and color palette to suit. If you give me 2-3 examples of websites you like the look and feel of it will help a lot.

If you want to integrate a payment portal or a third party service like a chat widget I can do so. If you have a system in mind, I can integrate it. If you want me to suggest a service, I would be happy to.

I do my best to make the experience of getting a new website as hassle-free as possible for my clients.

Here is some feedback I had from my last three projects:

"Josh was a delight to work with; always cooperative, creative, responsive and technically excellent at his job - went above and beyond."

Bec Evans and Chris Smith, Founders of Prolifiko
"Super easy to work with."

Kristin Braddock, Social Entrepreneur
"Working with Josh was a great experience. His sense of design, aesthetics, and flow of information was amazing. I am very pleased with his work and recommend him very highly."

-Raju Arora, Founder

If you would like me to redesign your website, I have put together two options for your company.

OPTION 1: Website redesign

This would involve a professional, modern website redesign. For this option you will need to provide the content (writing and images).

This option costs $2200 (which is $2000 plus 10% for Upwork)

OPTION 2: Website redesign + Copywriting + Technical SEO

This option involves redesigning you website as well as rewriting the content for your site.

I can create a simple, persuasive business narrative that helps emphasize the benefits of what you are offering to your customers.

I will then edit the content and optimize it for one Google search phrase and three keywords of your choice (I can help you choose these if you don't already have keywords).

I will also make sure that all of the websites complies with the latest web standards. Taking the time to do this means search engines will love your site. It also means the site will be accessible to blind people and the physically disadvantaged since screen readers work much the same way as search engines.

I have uploaded a black and white version of my design to show that I have already designed the site with colour-blind people in mind. I wanted to be as inclusive as possible.

The second option costs $4840 (which is $4400 plus 10% for Up work)

If you would like go for the second option, I will need to send you a questionnaire (or  we could speak over Skype) so that I have the information I need to get started.
Since I have spent considerable time putting this together, if you do not want to hire me all I ask if that you let me know why. Feedback is immensely helpful and will always be appreciated.

I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have before moving forward.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you.

Joshua Pitzalis
